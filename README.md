# GYMLY

Track your progress

## Getting Started

App created with Flutter and BLOC as state management.

The core of this app is to track small improvements, for efficient measurement of your progress in gym.

You can save for each sets the exact number of rep and weight, and immediately check to see if you've made any progress since the last week.
